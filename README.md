RAKSHA APP 

Raksha App is a real-time safety and emotional support application that I built from personal experience. As a normal person, I believe we all go through struggles — whether it's feeling unsafe, mentally overwhelmed, or simply needing someone to talk to. I created this app during a time when I realized how important it is to have immediate support from loved ones.

Raksha allows users to instantly alert their emergency contacts if they feel unsafe, especially while traveling in a cab or facing emotional distress. It helps notify your closest people through real-time alerts, so you’re never truly alone.

The app also provides quick access to important helpline numbers:

Women’s Helpline

Suicide Prevention

Mental Health Support

Assault Reporting

Just knowing someone is there — even digitally — can bring peace and safety during tough times.
